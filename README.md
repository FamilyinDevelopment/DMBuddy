# Ques2Go

This is a collection of  code snippets from various projects throughout the year at 
VFS programming for games web and mobile course. 

I have tried to include examples of code that contain a complete functionality or 
offer some kind of insite as to what the code was going to do. Some parts of code have
been obfuscated to protext API logon information or Parse Control Keys.
